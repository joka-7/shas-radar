/*
 * Where the API lives.
 *
 * The UI is deployed twice from this one `static/` directory: to Vercel as the
 * public frontend, and by FastAPI itself (`app/main.py` mounts this directory
 * at "/") so the *.onrender.com URL and local `uvicorn` keep working unchanged.
 * Those two cases differ only in whether the API shares the page's origin, so
 * that is the one thing decided here, at runtime -- no build step, no second
 * copy of this file to keep in sync.
 *
 * Why the split is worth it: on Render's free plan the service sleeps after 15
 * idle minutes and takes about a minute to wake. Served from Render, the page
 * *itself* waits on that wake, so a visitor stares at a blank "starting" screen
 * and the app looks broken. Served from Vercel's CDN the page paints at once and
 * its own boot fetches below start the wake immediately -- which then runs while
 * the visitor is reading the page and typing a search term, rather than in front
 * of nothing. The "waking the server" notice (armWaking in app.js) covers what
 * is left.
